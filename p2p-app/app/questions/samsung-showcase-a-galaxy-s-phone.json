    "text": "When speaking about car insurance rates for new drivers, it is important to separate the older new drivers from the younger ones. It is also necessary to segregate the new drivers who are purchasing their own independent policies from those who are added as less than a full-time driver to someone's policy that is already in force. These factors can greatly influence the cost of car insurance for new drivers."
